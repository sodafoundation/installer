# INSTALL SRM TOOLCHAIN #
#########################
# The SRM Toolchain is required if you wish to use the SODA Dashboard to view the metrics and visualization. 
# If you set this to true then the installer will install Prometheus:<version>, AlertManager<version> and Grafana<version>. 
# Please note that this installer will install the above as docker containers. 
# If you already have any of the above running then please make the appropriate 
# changes to the docker container name and ports at {srm_toolchain_dir}/docker-compose.yml
# If you set this to false then you will not be able to view the visualization using SODA Dashboard. 
# You can however configure your own dashboard or receiver to connect with Delfin.
